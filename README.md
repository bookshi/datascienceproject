# Hierarchical clustering of books.
# Description:
Using a dataset that contains a complete list of all books listed in goodreads. We want to divide books into different groups based on: author, book, number of pages, reviews and rating.

Our project will consist of 3 sprints
1st sprint
It consists of creating a team, subsequently considering topics of interest to us. Selecting a topic and collecting data (finding a suitable dataset). Registration in github, where the code will be written.
2nd sprint
It consists of the output of the dataset, after we clear the data. We study libraries which can be connected. We do the analysis, form clusters from data points and derive a dendrogram. It consists of building clusters to see how our data were actually clustered.
3rd sprint
Consists of working on errors (if any), outputting the final result.
